# Handwritten Digit Recognition
This project trained a neural network (NN) for the task of handwritten digit recognition. I implemented a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm for an NN using backpropagation.
Code are written in python 2. demo.py is the main file which calls all others. Report is mainly focused on analyzing training time and accuracy rate changes under different learning rate setup and different weight initialization setup.
